If website uses jquery, we can test the items we're searching for.
 - from inpect element (developer console), in the console, type $ and Enter.
 - - if it doesn't come back as Not Found or None or something, you have jquery.  Yay!
We can then type, for instance, $('div#location h1').text() to get the item (in h1) of the div id we want.

To get the current condition, we'll use $('#curCond .wx-value').text()
 - this will give us the text from the class (CSS for class is .) of the id curCond
